  <h2> Problem Definition </h2>
  <p>
    In this assignment Read and display video frames from a webcam
    Learn about tracking by template matching
    Learn about analyzing properties of objects in an image, e.g. object centroid, axis of least inertia, shape (circularity)
    Create interesting and interactive graphical applications
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
  <p>Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might
    describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or
    the mathematical formulation of your method. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Briefly outline the functions you created in your code to carry out the
  algorithmic steps you described earlier.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <h2>Experiments</h2>
  <p>
  Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
  performed, and the relevant parameter values.  </p>
  <p>
  Define your evaluation
  metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>
  
  
  <hr>
  <h2> Results</h2>
  <p>
  List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
  images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps. 
  <br>
   If your work involves videos, you can add links here, but also make
   sure to follow the specific homework instructions on how to submit
   videos.

  <h2> Discussion </h2>
  
  <p> 
  Discuss your method and results:
  <ul>
  <li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
  <li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
       are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
       experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
       results. </li>
  <li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
  would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
  failures/limitations of your work?</li> 
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <h2> Conclusions </h2>
  
  <p>
  Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
  main message?
  </p>
  
  
  <hr>
  <h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
  <p>
  
  Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
  your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
  year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
  information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
  location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
  institution).  
  
  <p>
  Material on the web should include the url and date of access.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
